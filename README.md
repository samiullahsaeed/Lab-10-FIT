Here is a simple calculator which performs basic arithmetic tasks like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
To run the calculator file in the folder:
Firstly, we open git bash whereever we want to create our folder and then we will create the folder using the mentioned command.
After that we will navigate into the folder and then we will create an empty repository.
Then we will create the file using the touch command and then open the file using nano command to write the code in it.
In the end we will return to the git bash console and then write ./calculator and then our simple calculator code will run.
To open the code in any coding editor we can use code file_name command. 
And to see our files we can use the ls command.
 mkdir folder_name - (To create the folder), 
 cd folder_name - (To navigate into the folder),
 git init - (To create empty repository in the folder),
 touch file_name - (To create a file),
 nano file_name - (To write the code inside the file using any suitable editor),
 code file_name - (To open the file in the suitable coding editor),
 ls - (To see our file / To see any file/folder as it lists all our files).
